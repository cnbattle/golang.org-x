This directory contains a simple core file for use in testing.

It was generated by running the following program with go1.9.0.

package main

func main() {
	_ = *(*int)(nil)
}

The core file includes the executable by reference using an absolute
path.  The executable was at /tmp/test, so that path is reproduced
here so the core dump reader can find the executable using this
testdata directory as the base directory.

core1.10 is produced in the same way, except using go1.10.0.
core1.11 is produced in the same way, except using go1.11.0.
